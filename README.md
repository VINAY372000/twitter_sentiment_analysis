# twitter_sentiment_analysis

This analysis focuses on analyzing public opinions by applying machine learning to Twitter data to perform sentiment analysis. The main goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their text content. The process typically involves several stages: first, raw tweet data is cleaned and preprocessed by removing noise like URLs, mentions, hashtags, and stopwords. 
Then, the text is converted into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, or word embeddings. A machine learning model (like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or an LSTM neural network) is trained on this processed data to learn sentiment patterns. After training, the model can predict the sentiment of new, unseen tweets, which can help businesses, politicians, and researchers track public opinion and emotional trends on social media platforms like Twitter.
